            <h2 class="section-heading">Problem</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                Students across the UC system often struggle to compare courses between campuses or interpret complex,
                inconsistently formatted prerequisite chains within their own. Each UC campus maintains unique catalog
                structures, numbering conventions, and prerequisite language, making it challenging to determine whether 
                courses are equivalent, partially aligned, or unrelated.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
                These problems especially affect UC–to–UC transfer students, who lack tools like Assist.org and must rely on
                tedious manual searches or limited advisor availability. Faculty also face difficulties understanding the 
                varied preparation their students bring. UC Course Matcher directly addresses these challenges by making course relationships transparent,
                comparable, and easy to navigate.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Methodology</h2>

            <h3 class="subheading">Data Collection</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Because UC course data has no API or unified source, we scraped catalogs using Selenium to handle dynamic,
                JavaScript-heavy pages. Each campus had different HTML structures, requiring custom scraping and cleaning 
                workflows. We compiled structured datasets for UC Davis, UCLA, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Cruz with fields such 
                as codes, titles, descriptions, prerequisites, units, and cross-listings.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Evaluation Set</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                We created a manually annotated dataset of 150 course pairs labeled as equivalent (2), similar (1), 
                or unrelated (0). This benchmark allowed us to measure how accurately embeddings captured course-level 
                semantics.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Embedding Testing</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Six leading models were evaluated using cosine similarity and Spearman correlation. 
                bge-base-en-v1.5 delivered the strongest performance and was selected for encoding all course descriptions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Prerequisite Graph Construction</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Prerequisite text was parsed into structured graphs using regex pattern extraction and virtual OR-nodes.
                Graphs were built using NetworkX, served through Flask, and visualized in the front end using Plotly. 
                A hierarchical layout with barycenter ordering improved clarity and reduced visual clutter.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Results & Findings</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                The bge-base-en-v1.5 embedding model achieved the highest Spearman correlation, AUC, and accuracy in identifying
                strong course matches. While e5-large-v2 performed slightly better for partially similar courses, overall ranking
                alignment was superior with BGE.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
                The prerequisite graphs generated clean, readable visualizations. Users can adjust depth, view hover-based details,
                and click nodes to explore connected prerequisite pathways efficiently. For example, classes such as MAT 22A and 
                STA 131A at UC Davis show how structural patterns, bottlenecks, and alternative pathways become more apparent 
                through deeper graph layers.
            </p>

        <div class="info-section">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Impact</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                UC Course Matcher provides a transparent, centralized way to explore UC course information. Transfer students can
                identify equivalent or highly similar courses, helping reduce redundant coursework and uncertainty. Within 
                campuses, prerequisite graphs give students a clear understanding of course sequencing and program structure. 
                Additionally, faculty gain more insight into the background preparation of incoming students. The framework can be 
                expanded to include additional campuses, larger evaluation sets, and broader compatibility analysis across programs.
